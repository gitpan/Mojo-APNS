NAME
    Mojo::APNS - Apple Push Notification Service for Mojolicious

VERSION
    0.0401

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an API for sending messages to an iPhone using
    Apple Push Notification Service.

    This module does not support password protected SSL keys.

SYNOPSIS
      use Mojo::APNS;

      my $apns = Mojo::APNS->new(
                  key => '/path/to/apns-dev-key.pem',
                  cert => '/path/to/apns-dev-cert.pem',
                  sandbox => 0,
                );

      $apns->on(drain => sub { $apns->loop->stop; })
      $apns->send(
        "c9d4a07c fbbc21d6 ef87a47d 53e16983 1096a5d5 faa15b75 56f59ddd a715dff4",
        "New cool stuff!",
        badge => 2,
      );

      $apns->on(feedback => sub {
        my($apns, $feedback) = @_;
        warn "$feedback->{device} rejected push at $feedback->{ts}";
      });

      $apns->ioloop->start;

EVENTS
  error
    Emitted when an error occur between client and server.

  drain
    Emitted once all messages have been sent to the server.

  feedback
      $self->on(feedback => sub {
        my($self, $data) = @_;
        # ...
      });

    This event is emitted once a device has rejected a notification. $data
    is a hash-ref:

      {
        ts => $rejected_epoch_timestamp,
        device => $device_token,
      }

    Once you start listening to "feedback" events, a connection will be made
    to Apple's push notification server which will then send data to this
    callback.

ATTRIBUTES
  cert
    Path to apple SSL certificate.

  key
    Path to apple SSL key.

  sandbox
    Booleand true for talking with "gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com" instead
    of "gateway.push.apple.com". Default is true.

  ioloop
    Holds a Mojo::IOLoop object.

METHODS
  on
    Same as "on" in Mojo::EventEmitter, but will also set up feedback
    connection if the event is "feedback".

  send
      $self->send($device, $message, %args);
      $self->send($device, $message, %args, $cb);

    Will send a $message to the $device. %args is optional, but can contain:

    $cb will be called when the messsage has been sent or if it could not be
    sent. $error will be false on success.

        $cb->($self, $error);

    *   badge

        The number placed on the app icon. Default is 0.
